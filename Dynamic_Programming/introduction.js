/*
    *** Dynamic Programming ***
    => A method for solving a complex problem by breaking it down into
    a collection of simpler subproblems, solving each of those subproblems
    just once, and stroing their solution.

    *** Which problem it's work ***
        => Optimal Substructure
        => Overlapping Subproblems

    Overlapping Subproblems: A problem is said to have overlapping
    subproblems if it can be broken down into subproblems which are
    reused several times.Example: Fibonacci Sequence. 

        * Subproblem(We break down one problem into smaller piece)
        * When i say overlapping subproblms, we need to look for repetition things where we are repeating some subproblem.
        * but no overlapping MergeSort, but subproblem.
       
    Optimal Substructure: A problem is said to have optimal substructure
    if an optimal solution can be constructed from optimal solutions
    of its subproblems. Shorted path to reach the good result or solution.
