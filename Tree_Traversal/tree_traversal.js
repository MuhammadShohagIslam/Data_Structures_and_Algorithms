        *** Tree Traversal ***
            => Tree Traversal is the one kind of  processing system through which we can visit all of the trees node.
            

        *** We can Traversing a tree two ways ***
            => Breadth-first Search(Starting at the beginning, then working across the tree)
            => Depth-first Search(Preorder, Postorder, Inorder) -> We just going down like our primary direction is going to the end of the tree vertically and coming back up and breadth first going across.
*/
/*
    *** Which is the better BFS Vs DFS ? ***
        => if we consider Space complexity, breadth first tree is the best.
        => if the tree is the very depth, depth first tree is take long space
    
    *** Use Case InOrder vs PreOrder vs PostOrder ***
        => If the we want to get all nodes in a tree in their underlying order, InOrdr Depth first tree is good.
        => PreOrder is the good , if we try to clone or duplicated tree, we want to store flatted in out
        => 
    *** Time Complexity of The Tree Traversal ***
        => Breadth first and depth first tree time complexity is the same beacuse every one visiting node one time
