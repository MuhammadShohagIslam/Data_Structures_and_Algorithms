/*
    *** Logarithm Complexity ***
        => Sometimes big O expressions involve more complex mathmatical expressions.
        => One that appears more often than we might like is the logarithm!

        => Logaritms time complexity is great!

    *** What is log? ***
        => What power gives us result or value
            log2(value) = exponent ----> 2 exponent = value

            we can use log2, log10, log3 but common logarithm is log2

        log === log2

/*
    *** Who Cares ? ***
        => Certain searching algorithms have logarithmic time complexity
        => Effieient sorting algorithms involve logarithms
        => Recursion sometimes involves logarithmic space complexity
